    """Collatz Conjecture aka 3x+1 problem: calculate number of steps required to reach 1

    :param number: integer - any positive integer n
    :return: integer - number of calculation steps needed to reach a value of 1

    Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide by 2 to get n/2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.
    Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach
    1 eventually.

    Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1
